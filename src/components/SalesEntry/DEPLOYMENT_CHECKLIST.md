## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Backup
```bash
[ ] Created backup of original PrintedBills.jsx
[ ] Backup verified and readable
```

### Step 2: Deploy New Files
```bash
[ ] Copy usePrintedBillsState.js to hooks/
[ ] Copy billsAPIService.js to services/
[ ] Copy billUtils.js to utils/
[ ] Copy ErrorBoundary.jsx to components/
[ ] Copy PrintedBillsRefactored.jsx
```

### Step 3: Update Main Component
```bash
[ ] Replace PrintedBills.jsx with refactored version
[ ] Verify imports are correct
[ ] Check no broken references
```

### Step 4: Clear Cache
```bash
[ ] Clear node_modules cache if using caching
[ ] npm install (if needed)
[ ] Clear browser cache
[ ] Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
```
